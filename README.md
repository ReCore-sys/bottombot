# Bottombot

Look, I'm sorry ok. This bot works. It turns on and does stuff. It's an absolute disgrace to the programming community and we would be better off without it. 


# Features

Far too many sleepless nights resulted in the following:

 - Music

 - Google and Image searching
 - Some basic moderation (I will add more)

## To Do

 ## How you can help

 - Financial support\
	 Got a spare $5? I am very happy to lighten up your wallet. But for real, this isn't cheap. I have a $120 raspberry pi to pay off and I don't want the chatbot nuking my CPU every time someone tries to use it.

 - Coding help\
   Got any experience with the dark arts of Python? If so, I would love your help. Feel free to make pull requests or whatever on the GitHub, or hit me up on Discord if you want to have a more ongoing contribution. What do you get for helping? A warm fuzzy feeling I guess.

 - Spreading the bot\
   Letting others know about this dumpster fire of a bot can help spread the word around. The more servers this bot is in, the more likely I am to find someone who can help with the above 2 options. Invite the bot to other servers, send invite links, anything helps.

 - Making suggestions\
   The more features the bot has the better. Only one issue with this: I can't seem to come up with any new ideas of what to add. Let me know on Discord if you want anything added and I will try my best.
